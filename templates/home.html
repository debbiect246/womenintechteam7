    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Here at Pedicoders we believe women are <strong>unstoppable</strong>.<br>
        Identifying as a woman brings a new and innovative perspective to a currently male dominated industry. <br>
        Despite common misconceptions, women make excellent coders. In fact, there is some suggestion women
        might even be better coders than men <a href="https://www.livescience.com/53729-bias-against-female-coders.html"
            target="_blank">*gasp*</a>. But women only get this recognition of being an excellent
        coder if they keep one single piece of information hidden: their gender. <br>
        <strong>We think it's time to change this. </strong> <br>
        So pull up a chair with your girlfriends and get coding. Whether you're a complete beginner, or seasoned
        professional, we want to hear from you all.
